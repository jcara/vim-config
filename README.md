# jcara's Vim config

Here it is, my minimalistic vim configuration. It serves my needs. 

## How to install

```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/jcara/vim-config.git ~/.vim
    sh ~/.vim/.install.sh
```

If there are any errors when creating symbolic links, be sure to back up your files before deleting them. Then try again.
